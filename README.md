# Analyzing-Sentiment-in-Twitter-for-Stock-Market-Trends
This is indeed a fascinating subject, with ample opportunities for further exploration, especially in the aspect of how sentiment is attributed to trades (this marked my initial foray into NLP). A deeper comprehension of tweet sentiment could yield more intriguing outcomes, though it's evident that the sentiment analyzer performs quite effectively overall. Comparing stock trends against the market benchmark could enhance the analytical value.
I supplemented the existing NLTK vocabulary with a modest financial lexicon. Perhaps it would be more beneficial to establish a new vocabulary specifically tailored to financial sentiment.
1.Exploring the relationship between a company's market value and public perception of that company.
2.Analyzing the sentiments of companies over time using a graph and providing explanations for potential declines and increases.
3.Assessing users who attempt to manipulate the social agenda by identifying and evaluating troll activity.
